<h3 align="center">This project was developed using the Node.js programming language. The system is responsible for managing service information in a fast food restaurant. The system has the possibility to make changes to your orders, including the name associated with the order. Each customer receives an ID, automatically generated by the system. After completing the order, the system updates the order status to "ready" through the ID.<h3>
